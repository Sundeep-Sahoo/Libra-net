ðŸ“– About the Project

LibraNet is a lightweight online library platform that demonstrates how object-oriented programming, clean design, and web technologies can come together to solve real-world problems.

This project was created as part of the iLEAD 2026 Challenge with the goal of building a reusable, extensible, and interactive system for managing different types of library items:

Books (with page counts)

Audiobooks (with playback durations, implementing a Playable interface)

E-Magazines (with issue numbers and archiving functionality)

The system allows users to:
âœ” Borrow and return items
âœ” Track availability in real-time
âœ” Automatically calculate fines (â‚¹10 per day overdue)
âœ” Parse borrowing durations and handle data securely

The application supports two modes of use:

Core Python Module (library_core.py) â€“ can be run directly in terminal for quick operations.

Flask Web App (app.py) â€“ provides a clean web-based interface for user interaction.

This project highlights:

Clean, reusable object-oriented design

Strong error handling and validation

Extensibility for future growth (like user authentication, search, and advanced analytics)

Gentle, library-inspired UI with HTML + CSS + Flask
